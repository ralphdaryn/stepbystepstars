            We hired Step by Step Stars for my sonâ€™s second birthday. The kids
            and especially the birthday boy had a wonderful time ðŸ™‚ Lauren was
            high energy and got both the kids and adults up and dancing. The
            video we received was adorable! High recommend Lauren and her team!
